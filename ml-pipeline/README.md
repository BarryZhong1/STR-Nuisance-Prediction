# 🏠 STR Nuisance Prediction System

*Smart enforcement for safer neighborhoods*

A machine learning system that helps cities predict which Short-Term Rental properties are most likely to cause problems, allowing enforcement teams to be proactive rather than reactive.
Sample based on public data from Open Data Scottsdale:https://data.scottsdaleaz.gov/

## 🌟 Why This Matters

**For City Officials & Enforcement Teams:**
- Spot problem properties before complaints pile up
- Focus limited resources where they're needed most  
- Make data-driven decisions backed by evidence
- Reduce response times and improve resident satisfaction

**For Residents:**
- Faster resolution of neighborhood issues
- Proactive prevention of nuisance situations
- Better quality of life in residential areas

**For Data Teams:**
- Modern, scalable ML infrastructure
- Easy integration with existing city systems
- Flexible deployment across cloud platforms

## 🔧 What It Does

### 📊 **Smart Risk Assessment**
The system analyzes patterns in:
- Historical complaint data
- Property characteristics
- Seasonal trends
- Neighborhood factors

Then assigns each STR property a risk score from 🟢 Low to 🔴 High

### 📈 **Interactive Dashboard**
![Dashboard Preview](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400/4CAF50/FFFFFF?text=Risk+Score+Dashboard)

- **Map View**: See high-risk properties on city map
- **Property Details**: Drill down into specific risk factors
- **Trend Analysis**: Track changes over time
- **Team Coordination**: Share insights across departments

### 🚨 **Automated Alerts**
Get notified when:
- New high-risk properties are identified
- Risk scores change significantly
- Complaint patterns emerge in specific areas

## 🌍 Built for Any City

Originally developed with Scottsdale's public data, but designed to work everywhere:

### 🏙️ **Multi-City Ready**
- **Flexible Data Formats**: Works with your existing data structure
- **Customizable Rules**: Adapt to your city's specific needs
- **Local Thresholds**: Set risk levels that make sense for your community
- **Multiple Languages**: Easy to localize for international use

### 📋 **Common Data Sources**
- Complaint/violation records
- STR permit databases  
- Property records
- Census/demographic data
- Previous enforcement actions

## ☁️ **Deploy Anywhere**

## 🛠️ Customization for Your City

### 📝 **Step 1: Data Mapping**
We help you map your data to our system:
- Complaint databases → Risk factors
- Property records → Predictive features  
- Enforcement history → Training data

### 🎛️ **Step 2: Configure Thresholds**
Set risk levels that work for your city:
```yaml
# Example: config/your_city.yaml
risk_thresholds:
  low: 0.0 - 0.3      # Green: Routine monitoring
  medium: 0.3 - 0.7   # Yellow: Increased attention  
  high: 0.7 - 1.0     # Red: Priority enforcement
```
